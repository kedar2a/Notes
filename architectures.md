# Software Architectures

* **Microservices**:
    * Microservices are an application architecture style where independent, self-contained programs with a single purpose each can communicate with each other over a network. Typically, these microservices are able to be deployed independently because they have strong separation of responsibilities via a well-defined specification with significant backwards compatibility to avoid sudden dependency breakage.
    * typically based on RESTful APIs
    * Only after the application proves its usefulness is it then broken down into microservice components to ease further development and deployment. This approach is called the "monolith-first" or "MonolithFirst" pattern.
* **CORRBA**:
    * The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is a standard defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) designed to facilitate the communication of systems that are deployed on diverse platforms. CORBA enables collaboration between systems on different operating systems, programming languages, and computing hardware. CORBA uses an object-oriented model although the systems that use the CORBA do not have to be object-oriented. CORBA is an example of the distributed object paradigm.
* **Microservers** will also increasingly be designed to handle specific types of computing tasks.
