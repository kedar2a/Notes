# DevOps

* Docker
* Serverless:
    * Serverless is a deployment architecture where servers are not explicitly provisioned by the deployer. Code is instead executed based on developer-defined events that are triggered, for example when an HTTP POST request is sent to an API a new line written to a file.
    * In between those extremes are levels that remove the need to worry about hardware (virtual private servers), up through removing concerns about web servers (platforms-as-a-service). 
        * AWS Lambda
        * Google Cloud Functions
