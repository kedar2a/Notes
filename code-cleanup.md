## Quotes
- "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."- Martin Fowler
- “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”
- the only valid measurement of code quality is the number of WTFs per minute
- “It’s not demolishing a two-story building with a wrecking ball; it’s defusing tens, if not hundreds, of bombs, when cutting the wrong wire can bring the whole website down,”
- "Don’t Cut the Red Wire!"


## Importance
- The quality of the code is directly correlated to the maintainability of the product.
- The ratio of time spent by a programmer reading code to writing code is normally 10 to one. You are constantly reading old code in order to write new code.
- Writing clean code makes the code easier to understand going forward and is essential for creating a successful maintainable product.


## Steps:
> Make It Tangible: Define Metrics and quantify loopholes, errors and looseends.
- Rule #1: When in Doubt, Don’t Cut the Wire
    + Do Not Over-cleanup
    + The Pareto principle (a.k.a. rule of 80/20) is your friend here.
- Rule #2: Focus!
    + Remember, you are doing open heart surgery, so focus, focus, and focus!
- Rule #3: Don’t Hit and Run, Dive Deep!
    + BFS or DFS? 
    + VCS to identify changes in particular commit(s).
- Rule #4: It’s Not a Massacre, It’s a Job for a Marksman
    - Go with multiple independently revert-able commits.
- Rule #5: Communicate! There Might Be Cross-Team Dependencies.
- It’s Not Done Until it’s Done Done
- Post Cleanup Task #1: Share the Results
- Post Cleanup Task #2: Monitor, and, Even Better, Set Alerts!
- Post Cleanup Task #3: Set up a Cadence or Threshold for Doing it Again


## Practice
- If you don’t have a routine code cleanup procedure in your development process, you are tying yourself to increasing tech debt.
- Code cleanup is a mandate.


## Good Code
- it takes a hell of a lot of more effort to write clean code. Writing clean code is hard work. It needs a lot of practice and focus during execution.
- To be able to write clean code you should train your mind over a period of time.
- lowering the level of complexity of the system can significantly reduce the number of bugs and your maintenance costs over time.


## Quality Code attributes
- Variable and method name
- Better Functions
- Comments
- Many more..
